      <p>I grew up in Long Beach/Cypress, CA and I started having an interest in computers at the age of 8 years old when our family got our first personal computer from a family member. My brother and I would mess around with it and play the classic mine game or solitaire. I really started to be a computer gamer when I started playing computer games like Diablo II, Warcraft, and Counter-Strike. It wasn't until I was in my freshman/sophmore year of highschool that I was exposed to programming. I took an HTML course that taught me how to minapulate websites. This allowed me to mess around with Myspace, which was the Facebook of that day. Since then, I have always had an interest in the web and the infinite possibilities that it posseses.</p>

      <p>I am now 27 years old and I live in Newport Beach, CA. My interests have changed but that fire to mainapulate the virtual world still keeps me pushing to create something great. Nowadays for fun I surf, play guitar, and golf. I love to spend time with my family, my girlfriend, my dog, Ollie and my surfing buddies. To this day, I still mess around with technology. I've taken apart and put back together laptops and smartphones just to see how they work and to resolve any problems that they may have. This brings me to why I'm taking this course at UCI, which is because I would like to create a company that makes this world better than we found it. Mahalo!</p>
